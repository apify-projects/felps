### Patterns Used
**1. Functional Programming / Pure functions**
- mostly based on functions building & interacting with objects (mostly no class instances)
- functions return identical values for identical arguments
- functions have no side-effects (no mutation of global variables)

For example, every module is instantiated via a method called `create` which returns a plain object.

**2. Hooks based**
- Provide a list of hooks as part of an module instance definition whenever possible to allow the user to control/extend its behavior

**3. Independent packages**
- Enforce a modular system to be able to use any module in any desired way
